## Identicize

For [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).  This app uses the API developed [here](https://github.com/theghall/odin-phototag-api).  This features the use of Javascript to build an SPA, Javascript objects to maintain the state of the game,  Promises (async/await) when fetching data from the API, and CSS Grid to style the HTML.

The app can be run [here](https://theghall.github.io/odin-phototag-app/).  It will present you with a list of challenges.  Upon clicking you will be presented with a screen with two parts.  On the left is a sideboard with the name of the challenge, how to play NOTE: if people are to be found, clicking their faces is how they are tagged; clicking on their bodies will do nothing.  How much time remaining if it is a timed challenge, or the elapsed time if untimed is displayed below that.  Below that is a list of items/people to find.  Each time an item is found it will be striked out. Below the image are notices that tell you which image to click if it is a directed challenge; That is you must find the items/people in a certain order.  If is a non-directed challenge it will just be a general message.  Other notices will appear here such as the results of the challenge or error messages.
